*Shape your ideas. Refine them. Collaborate with others.*

---

It was a school project, and
task sounded like this: 

`"Build web application or mobile app that solves a problem with social networking"`.

At that time, I was trying to use different sorts of things to store ideas, todos, knowledge in markdown and text data in general (Obsidian, Notion, etc.). 
Soon I realized that important part was not storing them, but consuming them after, revisiting. I recalled how much more productive I've felt
when other people were involved - it could be sharing your todos with someone, studying together, or creating something. That's kind of where
we got our idea from.

User can create what we call a canvas - a board with invisible grid where you can put markdowns and code snippets, which you can position and resize to your needs. (See example below)

The way items on canvas are positioned is stored in database, and we also account for breakpoints and different screen sizes. 

I would also have to say that we took a lot of inspiration from Figma, but not only visually - users are able to invite each other and modify canvas together.
